# Introduction

Welcome to the Tangled Program Graphs documentation! This framework is being developed by the Creative Algorithms Lab under Dr. Stephen Kelly.

## Overview

Our framework offers:

- Flexible architecture for MuJoCo environments and agents built upon Tangled Program Graphs
- Seamless integration with our Playground web application for experiment execution, visualization, and debugging.
- Convenient Command-Line Interface (CLI) for easy interaction with the framework
- RESTful API (built with FastAPI) for remote access and automation

## Engineering Initiatives: Bridging Research and Application

This project is not just a research endeavor, but a concerted effort to build a practical and accessible toolset for reinforcement learning. Key engineering initiatives include:

- **Playground Web App:** A React-based web application that provides a visual interface for designing, executing, and analyzing RL experiments.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** A powerful CLI tool that exposes core framework functionalities, enabling batch processing, scripting, and integration with other systems.
- **REST API:** A FastAPI instance that wraps the CLI, allowing programmatic access to the framework via standard HTTP requests. This facilitates remote experimentation and integration with other applications.
